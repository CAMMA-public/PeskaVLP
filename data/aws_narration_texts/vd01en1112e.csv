43.04,59.55,and this confirm that he have a long cystic duct remnant with the stone near the clip on the suspicion that the migration of this stone or other stand from this area could be cause with symptom and ercp be perform in an effort to remove it
74.64,82.47,it be decide to perform laparoscopic exploration and to attempt to remove the cystic duct remnant
101.1,104.29,some of these adhesion can be see here laterally
131.77,138.5,which be post just below the different and posterior around the round ligament with pull up the liver
138.68,142.59,and allow excellent exposure off the area below the liver
144.41,150.75,a very prominent leave hepatic artery can be see post cite in the low part of the field
155.24,158.99,dissection will start by take down the zoning total occasion
160.15,169.18,an additional trocar will be insert below the costal angle or retraction off the liver and the adhesion
190.74,195.25,we will start dissect these mental addition from the liver
285.02,297.72,these all adhesion and the peg tube tv in a ligament be now appear in the surgical field stay close to these known organ
317.18,327.21,we know that there be a clip sit right at the end of this long cystic duct and in this case it be very helpful as a soon as be identify with the clip
327.27,329.62,we will know with the rest of the cystic duct
343.36,347.07,lift patrick artery bulge into the operative field
355.04,359.62,it appear to be the cystic duct remnant in the center of the operative field
372.41,374.75,with dissection should be do here feli
376.7,378.55,aim to find that clip
383.64,385.72,use this careful dissection technique
386.03,394.46,it appear as if a cystic duct remnant be now hold in the lift and grasper and the hip be visible in the distance
397.84,404.98,weapon can not deduce at this stage from the dissection or from the preoperative imaging be whether a new connection
412.23,416.02,dissection need to continue carefully and one can not just willing
447.65,453.07,the hip be clearly visible and we will start careful dissection around the clip
459.84,464.28,we know from the image that this be probably the cystic duct hold here
464.53,473.16,but one do not know that this stage with its normal cystic duct with these and the right hepatic artery cross over
473.16,479.69,it notice that we put a swap into the abdominal cavity previously
495.9,501.32,dissection will continue in the plane between these vessel use traction and counter traction
509.95,517.24,the operative field be excellent due to the exposure to give by the suture on the right round ligament of the liver
529.84,533.95,once we have now identify the cystic duct remnant with certainty
541.44,544.05,the cystic duct be free adequately
552.34,576.85,the perfusion with this port be also important as it should be right above the area of dissection and parallel with the cystic duct to easily incision off the carotid ica scrub through it here after an incision will now be make in the cystic duct to allow for incision off the palatal scope
593.04,596.45,this be confirm by the release of bile on cut
597.64,611.36,another important point be their of the tip of the trocar nearest possible to this to minimize the movement off the lidocaine a scope inside the burden neuro cavity in this get no dye
611.36,616.19,lactation be need and the scope pass easily into the common bile duct
653.4,665.48,some fibrous also visible and here be a swing to right thumb and clearly see fortunately it be away from the pancreatic duct and unlikely to have coarse any damage in this patient
677.74,682.16,no stone illustrate anywhere in the common bile duct
687.34,691.77,the rest of the cystic that will be inspect with the scope
702.33,709.15,if the carotid august scope and the duct to be explore be pull into the same access as be show here
718.54,723.65,by simply open up the irrigation dental of the scope as we will do now
765.24,773.05,then we can safely divide the long cystic duct remnant from the clip and from the bottle duct
803.46,810.55,the distal end of the long cystic that remnant be now free just distally to the clip
843.77,856.94,this be actually a very long cystic duct and its no ligate flush with the common bile duct use a glucose suture here after both with dr
856.94,858.85,imminent and the suture will be cut
859.28,862.34,and the duct reamed and possibly contain the stone
