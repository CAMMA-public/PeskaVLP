52.74,59.65,the great omentum be reflect into left upper quadrant as show here over top of the transverse colon
77.54,90.7,the proximal small bowel be also place in the left upper quadrant show here and a grasper be place orthostatically and the bowel proximal portion of the bowel be suspend for this
116.82,121.35,we begin by open the retroperitoneum in the region of the sacred promontory
122.23,130.41,this incision be then carry down towards the rectum and up over the body of aorta in order to expose the inferior mesenteric artery
148.54,155.48,which you see here now that we have located inferior mesenteric artery
170.61,171.8,we use the ligasure device
171.8,174.17,which both seal and cut the vessel
175.34,183.65,it be very important at this point do not overshoot the inferior mesenteric artery as the hypogastric plexus life just lateral to where we be work
216.95,220.2,we be continue our dissection again anterior tell fascia
220.74,224.35,which be see just below be ligasure device
238.24,242.48,dyskinetic demonstrate how the peritoneum will be open on the anterior surface
249.74,253.25,the last step be open the lateral portion of the peritoneum
266.27,273.72,the white line of tell be take down use the ligasure device and you concede this device
292.73,303.69,the left iliac artery now approach director signal junction
314.53,321.25,a rectum to get down just to the wall of the rectum and the distal sigmoid colon
327.42,369.54,we will divide it use an interstate by divide the mucosa rectum in this fashion with iv distal blood supply to the rectum intact and you can see here that we have adequate immobilize the mucosa rectum at this point
435.94,442.42,this be a schematic of how we protect our wound with a wound skirt or wound protector bag a specimen
442.42,450.05,and then with draw a double protect specimen to try to prevent the possibility of disseminate cancer cell into the subcutis space
486.64,491.71,the specimen which have be bag and catch device be not with draw through the wound
494.86,496.55,be extract the specimen here
551.65,561.14,the anvil since down the pursestring device and reinsert the specimen into the body close off
561.14,570.55,be wound protector to reestablish pneumoperitoneum and use the pursestring device itself to clamp this for adequate pneumoperitoneum
588.04,594.45,the device be deploy and the pin be remove and extract
596.7,611.05,the anvil be make it with his circular stapling device and make sure that the colon be not twist
617.24,626.64,we then close the device in the double check to make sure there be no twist the mesentery
635.74,639.85,the second assistant check to make sure that the next timoptic specimen be adequate
