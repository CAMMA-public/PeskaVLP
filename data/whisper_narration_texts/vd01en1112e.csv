0.0,27.2,this is an interesting patient who previously had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed
27.2,28.76,and was well posed operatively
28.76,34.16,the patient now presents with episodic pain in the right upper quadrant which raised the
34.16,38.92,suspicion of a residual stone in the biliary tree
38.92,45.72,this was investigated with mri cholangiography and this confirmed that he had a long cystic
45.72,49.92,duct remnant with a stone near the clip
49.92,54.78,on the suspicion that the migration of this stone or other stones from this area could
54.78,60.42,be causing the symptoms an ercp was performed in an effort to remove it
60.42,68.94,however despite an adequate sphincterotomy the stone could not be removed in this manner
68.94,73.02,after the patient had developed another episode of pain and because he was in a very good
73.02,80.2,clinical condition it was decided to perform laparoscopic exploration and to attempt to
80.2,88.2,remove the cystic duct remnant
88.2,96.02,in addition to the previous laparoscopic cholecystectomy the patient had also had an appendicectomy
96.02,101.34,and exploration of the right kidney for a pelvic ureteric stone
101.34,106.04,some of these adhesions can be seen here laterally
106.04,114.44,this is the area of the appendicectomy and a band like this is actually dangerous and
114.44,117.4,can cause later small bowel obstruction
128.72,134.64,the liver is suspended with an atraumatic suture which is passed just below the xiphoid
134.64,137.5,and passed around the round ligament
137.5,143.24,this pulls up the liver and allows excellent exposure of the area below the liver
143.24,149.56,in this case a very prominent left hepatic artery can be seen pulsating in the lower
155.8,160.9,dissection will start by taking down these omental adhesions but first an additional
160.9,168.26,trocar will be inserted below the costal angle for retraction of the liver and the
168.26,169.26,adhesions
169.26,176.46,it is so important in laparoscopic surgery to have good exposure as 50s or more of all
176.46,181.86,cases of conversion are probably due to inadequate exposure
181.86,187.18,therefore it is no problem to insert one more trocar if this will aid in exposure of the
187.18,190.82,operative field
190.82,196.8,we will now start dissecting these omental adhesions from the liver
196.8,204.02,usually they strip away easily but diathermy and scissors can be used as needed
204.02,210.26,a good surgical plane is usually present near to the known anatomy in this case near to
210.26,218.24,the underside of the liver and that is probably the best plane for dissection
218.24,223.08,if there is bowel near to the liver in this case or bowel near to the adhesions one should
223.08,231.08,obviously have prudent use of the diathermy
231.08,237.08,in cases like these where a lot of diathermy is used one generates a fair amount of smoke
237.08,242.74,and it is to open one of the ports slightly and this acts as a vent for the smoke
242.74,250.98,and clear the operative field
250.98,259.62,because of all these adhesions it will be difficult to directly find a cystic duct stump
265.1,272.22,to look for the hepatoduodenal ligament and dissect that out first because once again
272.22,285.26,that is a known structure
285.26,290.56,these are all adhesions and the hepatoduodenal ligament is now appearing in the surgical
296.1,301.94,staging close to these known organs we have up to now known exactly where we are dissecting
301.94,312.66,and there has been no danger to the patient or to structures
312.66,320.62,going back now to the imaging we know that there is a clip sitting right at the end of
320.62,326.54,this long cystic duct and in this case it is very helpful as as soon as we have identified
326.54,341.78,the clip we will know where the rest of the cystic duct is
341.78,346.62,once again there is a very prominent left hepatic artery bulging into the operative
346.62,355.14,field and which appears slightly ectopic
355.14,360.38,it appears to be the cystic duct remnant in the centre of the operative field but at this
360.38,371.82,stage one can not be sure
371.82,383.94,therefore all dissection should be done carefully aiming to find the clip
383.94,388.98,using this careful dissection technique it appears as if the cystic duct remnant is now
388.98,398.1,held in the left hand grasp and the clip is visible in the distance
398.1,403.54,what one can not reduce at this stage from the dissection or from the preoperative imaging
403.54,408.98,is whether a new connection is formed between the tip of the cystic duct remnant and the
412.22,417.5,the entire dissection needs to continue carefully and one can not just cut around
417.5,420.34,the area of the clip
420.34,432.46,a connection is possible due to the inflammation around the residual stone and the clip
432.46,447.62,here is the clip and we will now carefully free the area around it
447.62,459.98,there the clip is clearly visible and we will now start careful dissection around the clip
459.98,466.02,you know from the imaging that this is probably the cystic duct held here but one does not
466.02,472.38,know at this stage whether it is only cystic duct or whether there is a right hepatic artery
476.22,481.42,notice that we put a soap into the abdominal cavity previously and this is very useful
481.42,486.06,to soap away small leaders as in this case
486.06,491.7,here are now three structures and it is indeed a problem which of those are cystic duct
491.7,495.26,which is common bile duct and which is the artery
495.26,500.1,therefore dissection will continue in the plane between these vessels using traction
500.1,509.18,and counter traction as illustrated
509.18,515.62,once again the operative field is excellent due to the exposure given by the suture on
515.66,520.46,the round ligament of the liver but also the other forceps
520.46,526.54,we can go back to the imaging again to check the exact position of the long cystic duct
526.54,530.06,in relation to the common bile duct
530.06,536.46,once we have now identified the cystic duct remnant with certainly we can commence inspecting
536.46,541.54,it with cholangioscopy
541.54,548.22,the cystic duct is freed adequately and a fifth port is now inserted just below the
548.22,552.42,costal angle for insertion of the
552.42,557.3,the position of this port is also important as it should be right above the area of dissection
557.3,563.1,and parallel with the cystic duct to ease the insertion of the through
570.3,575.74,hereafter an incision will now be made in the cystic duct to allow for insertion of
584.1,593.2,a transverse incision is certainly the easiest as it opens up the cystic duct very nicely
593.2,597.98,this is confirmed by the release of bile on cutting
598.02,602.82,another important point is to have the tip of the trocar as near as possible to this
602.82,610.58,to minimize the movement of the inside the peritoneal cavity
610.58,623.78,in this case no dilatation is needed and the scope passes easily into the common bile duct
623.78,628.82,one can then go distally here is the pancreatic duct the duct of version and this is the site
628.82,635.38,of the previous sewing teratoma and one can actually enter the small bowel as is illustrated
637.1,642.14,this was very easy without applying any pressure
642.14,647.64,this obviously opens the possibility that any stone found can be pushed through the
647.64,653.54,sewing teratoma into the small bowel and that will be the end of the problems
653.54,658.38,some fibrin is also visible and here is the sewing teratoma clearly seen
658.38,664.46,fortunately it is away from the pancreatic duct and unlikely to have caused any damage
664.46,671.14,in this patient
671.14,682.62,no stone is illustrated anywhere in the common bile duct
682.7,687.42,this is obviously distal to the attachment of the cystic duct
687.42,693.82,the rest of the cystic duct will now be inspected with the scope pushing a retrograde into the
693.82,698.04,remnant
698.04,704.52,as with all these procedures the procedure is correctly simplified if the
704.52,713.48,and the duct to be explored is pulled into the same axis as is shown here
713.48,720.4,usually one can flush out any stones found or any remnants found by simply opening up
720.4,736.46,the irrigation channel of the scope as we will do now
736.46,741.2,the actual stone is not visible in this remnant but we know from the preoperative imaging
741.2,746.0,that it is probably sitting in the distal end of the stump
751.94,756.46,there is the distal end of the stump and there is no connection with the rest of the biliary
762.68,770.1,the can now be removed and we can safely divide the long cystic duct remnant
770.1,773.0,from the clip and from the bile duct
800.1,813.58,the distal end of the long cystic duct remnant is now freed just distally to the clip taking
813.58,822.74,care not to damage the artery which can be seen to run quite near to it
822.74,828.34,we also know from the preoperative imaging that the common hepatic duct is running just
828.34,830.46,below this area here
830.46,843.9,therefore dissection is done still carefully and with minimal application of the diathermy
843.9,848.66,this is actually a very long cystic duct and it is now ligated flush with the common bile
848.66,854.86,duct using a loop suture
854.86,861.08,after both the duct remnant and the suture will be cut and the duct remnant possibly
861.08,865.62,containing the stone will be removed through one of the ports
865.62,867.14,that will be the end of the procedure
