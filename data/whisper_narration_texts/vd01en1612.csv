0.0,15.32,this video will demonstrate laparoscopic appendicectomy
15.32,21.8,the main indication for laparoscopic appendicectomy is right iliac fossa pain of origin
21.8,26.84,the laparoscopic approach offers better cosmetic results and faster recovery compared to open
26.84,35.88,appendicectomy
35.88,40.2,the patient is placed in a trendelenburg position with slight left tilt
40.2,42.92,the surgeon is placed to the left of the patient
42.92,48.16,following correct patient positioning and direct insufflation two trocars are placed
48.16,56.08,one 5 mm trocar in the left iliac fossa and one 10 mm trocar in the suprapubic region
56.08,63.4,a thorough exploration of the abdominal cavity is performed in search for the curative pathology
63.4,71.64,the gynecological organs look normal
71.64,78.6,small bowel loops are gently retracted to expose the pelvis for a thorough inspection
78.6,91.48,there is some free fluid in the pelvis but the organs otherwise look normal
91.48,104.76,this is the cecum and we can now see the appendix which is situated
104.76,113.2,the dissection is commenced to free the appendix and divide the meso appendix
113.2,123.6,a window is created at the base of the meso appendix near the cecum
123.6,130.28,the grasp is then passed through this window and a ligature
130.28,136.92,this will be used to ligate the meso appendix for division
136.92,153.04,the ligature is held and the knot pusher is introduced to ligate the meso appendix
153.04,168.16,the meso can now be safely divided
168.16,172.0,the appendix itself can now be ligated
172.0,185.2,this is done using the same technique again using the knot pushing device
185.2,192.24,once the base of the appendix is controlled we can crush part of the stump as shown
192.24,194.4,the appendix can then be divided
194.4,199.52,we then carefully withdrawn the appendix making sure not to release the free end
199.52,205.76,this is done at a distance of 5 mm from the point of ligature
205.76,211.68,a stitch is now placed to bury the stump
211.68,228.48,an absorbable monofilament stitch is used with the seromuscular technique
228.48,234.72,again the extracorporeal knot tying facilitates the trial of the stump
234.72,238.48,a final check for haemostasis and viability is made
238.48,239.92,this is the end of the operation
