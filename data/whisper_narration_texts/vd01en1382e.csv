0.0,21.18,today procedure is sigmoidectomy for resection of colon cancer
21.18,23.76,the surgeon stands at the patient 's right side
23.76,27.84,his first assistant is to his left on the patient 's right side and the second assistant
27.84,31.44,stands between the patient 's legs
31.44,34.12,for this procedure we use a total of six trocars
34.12,38.68,three are positioned in the right midclavicular line two in the midline and one in the left
38.68,44.2,midclavicular line
44.2,47.44,the first step of the procedure is to expose our operative field
47.44,52.8,we begin with two trocars shown here and the camera at the umbilicus
52.8,58.4,the greater omentum is reflected into the left upper quadrant as shown here over top
58.4,63.44,of the transverse colon
63.44,72.8,you can see here the transverse colon
72.8,77.64,the next step of the procedure is exposure and retraction of the small bowel
77.64,85.0,the proximal small bowel is also placed in the left upper quadrant shown here and the
85.0,90.04,grasper is placed and the proximal portion of the bowel is suspended
99.9,113.86,this diagram illustrates the approach that we take behind the peroneal surface
113.86,119.18,after the bowel has been adequately positioned and mobilized we begin by opening the retroperitoneum
119.18,122.42,in the region of the sacral promontory
122.42,127.4,this incision is then carried down towards the rectum and up over the body of the aorta
127.4,145.52,in order to expose the inferior mesenteric artery
145.52,153.2,our dissection at this point is to the right side of the aorta which you see here
153.2,157.36,now that were located the inferior mesenteric artery the first step for an oncological procedure
157.4,169.56,is to divide this and take all of the lymphatic basin feeding the sigmoid colon
169.56,175.48,in order to accomplish this we use the ligature device which both seals and cuts the vessel
175.48,181.18,its very important at this point to not the inferior mesenteric artery as the hypogastric
181.18,190.9,plexus lies just lateral to where were working
190.9,198.3,the division of the mesocolon is extended cephalad as shown here and you can see toldt fascia
198.3,201.26,just here behind the mesocolon
201.26,216.82,we need to stay in front of toldt fascia in order to perform an adequate oncologic excision
216.82,222.5,now were continuing our dissection again anterior to toldt fascia which is seen just
222.5,238.46,below our ligature device
238.46,243.06,this schematic demonstrates how the peritoneum will be opened on the anterior surface in
243.06,249.9,the relative position of the ureter and the gonadal vessels underneath the mesosigmoid
249.9,257.98,the last step is opening the lateral portion of the peritoneum
266.38,273.66,the white line of toldt is taken down using the ligature device and you can see this device
273.66,282.7,provides us with a hemostatic field and is really ideal for this type of surgery
282.7,291.62,we then continue coda towards the rectosigmoid junction
291.62,301.86,to the left of the screen is the left iliac artery
301.86,312.1,now were approaching the rectosigmoid junction
312.1,317.94,at this point we begin the division of the superior mesorectum to get down just to the
317.94,324.94,wall of the rectum in the distal sigmoid colon
325.02,332.02,once were adequately stripper this region we will divide it using an endostapler
345.18,348.94,by dividing the mesorectum in this fashion we leave the distal blood supply to the rectum
358.94,365.94,and you can see here that were adequately mobilized the mesorectum
365.94,372.94,at this point we fire an endogia stapler
373.94,380.94,usually this requires two fires
380.94,387.94,and we have thus accomplished our distal division
392.94,396.94,this is our target
397.94,400.94,because of the orientation of the bowel and the mesocolon its easy to do this from a
400.94,407.94,position on the patient 's right side
407.94,411.94,now that we have adequately divided both the distal and proximal mesosigmoid we can do
411.94,418.94,our proximal division
426.94,433.94,this is a schematic of how we protect our wound with a wound skin or wound protector
433.94,438.94,bag the specimen and then withdrawn a double protected specimen to try to prevent the possibility
438.94,445.94,of dissemination cancer cells into the sub space
445.94,452.94,we begin by opening our suprapubic port incision an atic of a small small small small
452.94,458.94,and on the big screen you see the insertion which is now reversed of our wound protector
483.94,490.94,the specimen which has been ragged and of ice is then withdrawn through the wound
490.94,498.94,protector with double protection and you can see us extracting the specimen here
498.94,503.94,at this point we will continue some additional lateral mobilization at the white line of
504.94,511.94,toldt in order to adequately mobilize the colon and form our anastomosis
515.94,522.94,this patient does not require a full mobilization of the splenic flexure
523.94,527.94,now that we have adequately mobilized the descending colon we need to bring the distal
527.94,532.94,portion of our bowel out through our wound protector to exteriorized it and place the anvil
537.94,544.94,once the distal portion of our bowel has been exteriorized we form hemostasis place a
544.94,556.94,device remove our stapler line place the anvil cinch down the device and
556.94,563.94,reinsert the specimen into the body close off our wound protector to establish pneumoperitoneum
563.94,570.94,and use the device itself to clamp this for adequate pneumoperitoneum
577.94,581.94,you can see here were inserting the circular stapler for an anastomosis via
581.94,583.94,the rectum
587.94,594.94,the device is deployed and the pin is removed and extracted
594.94,608.94,at this point the anvil is mated with the circular stapling device and making sure that
608.94,623.94,the colon is not twisted which its not we then close the device and double check
623.94,627.94,to make sure there are no twists to the mesentery which there are not
627.94,630.94,its fired and removed
631.94,639.94,the second assistant checks to make sure that the anastomotic specimens are adequate and
639.94,644.94,then additionally we perform an air test shown here with no evidence of leaks
