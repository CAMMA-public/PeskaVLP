0.0,20.0,the patient is presented with symptoms compatible with acute appendicitis
20.0,23.28,these place supine with the left arm tucked along the body
23.28,31.2,the surgical team is located at the left of the patient with the monitor at the right
31.2,37.84,access to the peritoneum is done under direct vision using a modified hasson technique
37.84,41.8,she was brought to the or for exploration of the abdominal and pelvic cavities and possible
47.26,59.66,the peritoneum is now open and the first stroke are introduced under direct vision
59.66,66.42,pneumoperitoneum is done for a pressure of 12 millimeters of merry
66.42,79.94,the abdominal pelvic cavity is explored and there are no growth anomalies
79.94,87.3,the other trocars are placed as such
87.3,92.22,a five millimeter trocars is inserted just medial to the left anterior superior iliac
92.22,96.5,spine
96.5,104.02,we can see here the epigastric vessels and the second five millimeter trocar is placed
104.02,107.66,four to five centimeters above the pubis at the midline
107.66,113.78,and to avoid injury of organs a counter pressure is made with the grasper while introducing
113.78,118.78,the stroke r b before pushing the stroke on completely
118.78,125.22,an alternative is to push the trocar inside of the optical trocar as is often done in
125.22,140.58,pediatric surgery
140.58,146.42,the patient is placed in position and the small bowel is retracted cephalad
146.42,149.7,loop by loop
149.7,165.26,while doing so the left allal loop is explored to eliminate the presence of a manual diverticulum
165.26,168.86,the pelvic cavity is explored as well
168.86,181.9,here the uterus the right which is normal and the left adnexa as well
181.9,185.3,the appendix is found here
185.3,189.34,it is slightly subserosal and seems to be very long
189.34,197.1,it is followed until its tip
197.1,199.9,the cecum is very mobile
199.9,213.06,here the tip of the appendix which looks slightly inflammatory
213.06,223.82,we begin with division of the meso appendix
223.82,231.46,the meso appendix can be divided with monopolar or bipolar coagulation or with clips
231.46,237.26,here the maryland grasper with monopolar coagulation is used to divide the meso appendix
238.26,245.58,this is performed bit by bit and close to the appendiceal wall
253.82,263.34,the serosal attachments are divided at the same time and the last allal loop is slowly
283.5,294.66,to achieve a good the appendix is rolled around a grasper
294.66,303.9,were slowly reaching now the base of the appendix and now scissors with monopolar coagulation
313.94,323.7,the appendix will now be ligated with the end loop
323.7,331.82,the end loop is introduced through the suprapubic port
331.82,338.58,and is closed at the base of the appendix
338.58,342.1,the base of the appendix is then milked
342.1,346.7,the grasper closes the lumen
346.7,364.1,the appendix will now be divided partly after cutting the end loop
364.1,371.9,and now the mucosa of the appendiceal stump is coagulated
371.9,382.78,the rest of the appendiceal wall is cut
382.78,395.58,and the appendix is exteriorized through the optic port under direct vision
395.58,400.82,the peritoneum is explored one last time and hemostasis is checked
