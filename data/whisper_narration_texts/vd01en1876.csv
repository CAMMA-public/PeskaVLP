0.0,29.88,may first step its a vertical eight or nine millimeter skin incision in front umbilical
29.88,39.44,second step is the dissection of the subcutaneous plan
39.44,45.2,i have to find the anterior layer of the rectus muscula
45.2,52.24,and now i perform a 10 millimeter incision in the anterior rectal sheet
52.24,57.84,in a bilateral you would just go on the one with the suggest side or just
57.84,64.4,i use eight millimeter round because i have to avoid a leakage a gaze leakage
64.4,75.28,and so in this case i use eight or nine millimeter port skin incision
75.28,84.12,i push i place my scissor my shears just under the anterior layer
84.12,93.0,i place the retractor the first one may and you can see perfectly the rectal muscula
95.0,104.88,with my second retractor i push out the rectal muscula
104.88,109.4,and so you can see perfectly the posterior layer
109.4,112.36,you say youde retracted the rectus muscle naturally
113.6,114.6,and we see the posterior sheet
115.6,120.52,and you have to place your port just between the two layers two shields
120.52,123.4,that is a brown trocar kaye
123.4,132.44,i push it slowly between the two layers and that all
132.44,135.8,so that will be a co2 sealed
137.8,140.32,i enter in the port
142.06,145.34,you can see posteriorly the posterior layer
146.34,149.66,and up the rectal muscula
153.7,160.86,and you can see immediately the shape of the fascia propria
160.86,169.1,that is the tissue between the extra peritoneal tissue
175.94,179.66,and i create some channel in this tissue
183.18,186.54,we done have any resistance
186.54,194.06,you can see now that is a good space for the placement of my second port
194.06,197.82,and i have the physical contact with the symphysis
197.82,199.82,you can see the cooper is just here
199.82,202.98,yes we can see the cooper ligament on the left
202.98,205.82,and now i place my second port
205.82,215.86,may the second port is laterally two millimeters laterally to the middle line and two laterally
215.86,221.58,above under the umbilical line
221.58,224.48,its a five millimeter port
224.48,232.48,and you have to place your port just in the good space
232.48,237.86,first of all i have to coagulate just this whole vessel
237.86,245.24,you can see laterally what is it that is epigastric pedicle
245.24,253.12,the first step is my first landmark is the symphysis
256.76,263.16,i m carry i done have any coagulation but its not a problem
263.16,268.16,yes here a small vessel come from the epigastric vessel and they are going to the muscula
274.16,280.16,i explained that my first landmark is the cooper ligament on the symphysis
282.2,286.2,you can see the cooper ligament
287.2,291.2,and that is the obturator foramen
292.2,295.88,with the vessel with the vein on the nerve
295.88,300.88,normally that is the inferior limit of your dissection laterally
300.88,303.6,that is my first landmark the symphysis
303.6,309.72,now i go up and i find the linear quate
311.76,316.76,its crossing between the epigastric vessel and the linear quate
316.76,318.76,now this is the arch ligament
318.76,323.48,this is the posterior sheath where the posterior sheath is finished and gone laterally
323.48,326.92,that is the inferior limit of the posterior sheath
326.92,332.36,and that is the k for the dissection of the bogros space
332.36,335.96,you can see the sheath and normally i get it
337.2,342.72,i increase the size of my pocket of dissection
342.72,348.36,you can see the shape of the extra versus muscular
351.48,359.64,and you increase step by step the size of your dissection of your lateral pocket until
359.64,366.28,you find the limit between the umbilical line and the axillary line
366.28,369.16,you can see my scissor just here
371.16,378.16,and that is the placement for my third trocar
378.16,386.96,i push it to the skin incision and now i push it and that is the placement of my second port
390.96,398.2,you have the psoas muscula with the nerve
398.2,402.88,that is the famous triangle of the nerve
402.88,408.48,no steeper no fixation in this area
408.48,415.68,and that is the fascia transversalis is just here with the lateral vein come from the epigastric
415.72,424.24,pedicle and this small vein is sometimes dangerous during the fixation of the mesh
424.24,428.24,you have to be careful for your dissection
436.24,440.24,you have to reduce the small lipoma
440.8,450.8,i adjust in front of the iliac artery and the iliac vein
452.8,460.8,and that is the pedicle with just here is the vas deferens
461.36,471.36,be careful during this dissection done injure the vessel and keep together the vas deferens
471.36,473.36,on the spermatic vessel
473.36,481.36,personally i use a split mesh but it is not a rule
481.92,491.92,a lot of surgeons use only a plain mesh without a split
491.92,501.92,i use a split but for me it is very nice because i think that i can avoid the recurrences by
501.92,505.92,overlapping on the interior flap of the mesh
505.92,509.92,can you just show them the edge of the perineum
520.48,524.48,it is very important not to make a hole in this because otherwise you will get the
524.48,530.48,pneumoperitoneum as the co2 in the extra peritoneal space goes into the abdomen
530.48,534.48,that tends to limit the space you can operate in
534.48,538.48,but if i perform a hole in the peritoneum now it is not really a problem
539.04,545.04,because we have a good balance with operation intra and extra abdominal
547.04,559.04,only the peritoneum is vertical with the same pressure extra and intra peritoneum
561.04,567.04,the problem is if you perform a hole at the beginning of the dissection after it is difficult
571.6,577.6,i dissect just until the vas deferens cross the cular ligaments
579.6,581.6,you can see the doomed triangle
581.6,589.6,the doomed triangle is a triangle between the vas deferens and the spermatic vessel
591.6,595.6,it is the artery and the vein and the lymph nodal around
596.16,598.16,done dissect this area
600.16,602.16,i show you the fascia transversalis
606.16,608.16,and that is the vena
608.16,616.16,that is a direct vena with a lipoma inside
618.16,622.16,the fascia transversalis is just here
622.72,624.72,now it is over for the dissection
628.72,636.72,i reverse the fascia transversalis to avoid a seroma after
636.72,642.72,i push from outside and i reverse this fascia
642.72,648.72,and i fix it with a stapler on the cular ligament
655.28,659.28,now i have to prepare the mesh
659.28,665.28,i use a 5 mm grasper that comes from the 5 mm port
677.84,679.84,i push it laterally
679.84,683.84,now i have to prepare the mesh
683.84,691.84,first of all that is the shape for the cular ligament
691.84,697.84,and now i go laterally in the direction of the psoas
702.4,710.4,the design of the shape of this mesh is different according to the anatomy of the patient
710.4,720.4,the most important thing is the distance to the pubis line
720.4,724.4,i cut it in the middle because i use a split mesh
728.96,734.96,i remove a small triangle of tissue of material
742.96,746.96,and i cross the external on the internal
746.96,752.96,so i reproduce exactly the shape of the inguinal area
755.52,761.52,and the cord goes through the hole
761.52,769.52,but you done have a hole in front of the hole because it is a zigzag way
769.52,773.52,i reproduce the zigzag way
773.52,781.52,i fold my mesh like an according with my finger very easily
782.08,792.08,i take it with my grasper and the split is up
792.08,794.08,i introduce an internal part
794.08,798.08,now i fold the external part
798.08,802.08,so i introduce the mesh in the port
802.08,806.08,i push it under the cord
806.64,816.64,i push and immediately with the memory of the tissue the internal part is placed
816.64,822.64,the same thing for the external part
822.64,828.64,may that is the external part
828.64,834.64,may and that is the internal part
835.2,839.2,and i cross the external on the internal
839.2,845.2,and you can see the epigastric pedicle
847.2,855.2,and the internal part of the split follows exactly the epigastric pedicle
855.2,863.2,and so that is so important because when i stapler this area i am sure that i done stapler the epigastric pedicle
863.76,869.76,so the stapler is perpendicular
871.76,877.76,i done fix it just above because you can have a restriction of the cord
879.76,881.76,you can see the small triangle
881.76,885.76,i resect a small triangle
890.32,894.32,i push from outside with my finger and i fix it
894.32,896.32,two for me this is the security
898.32,908.32,i fix it just above the symphysis and just a point on the cooper ligament
910.32,914.32,and you can see the mesh is placed
914.32,918.32,that is the cord
918.88,924.88,and the posterior layer with the psoas muscula with the nerve
926.88,930.88,and you can see that the mesh covers all the area
934.88,942.88,and i split the mesh because i think that i avoid the recurrences by overlapping of the mesh
943.44,951.44,the danger is that if you push the mesh place the mesh on the cord you can have during the inflation
951.44,955.44,an overlapping of the mesh and immediately recurrences
955.44,959.44,in this case its impossible because its closed
959.44,963.44,may now we proceed to the inflation
